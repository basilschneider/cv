\section{Analysis activities in ATLAS (up to 2015)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I was the main analyzer of the search for charginos and neutralinos in
        events with three leptons and missing transverse momentum based on 8 fb$^{-1}$
        of data collected by ATLAS at $\sqrt{s}$~=~8~TeV (JHEP 04 (2014 169)). A large
        improvement in sensitivity was obtained, compared to previous analyses, by
        splitting the signal region in multiple bins depending on several kinematic
        variables and the multiplicity of taus in the final state. In addition to
        leading the analysis effort, I guided the optimization of the signal region
        for the final states with at least one tau. I was chosen to present the
        analysis in front of the collaboration for its approval.
  \item I carried out the statistical interpretations for four publications in
        ATLAS, all searching for supersymmetry in either three lepton or four lepton
        final states (Phys. Rev. D 93, 052002 (2016), Phys. Rev. D. 90, 052001 (2014),
        JHEP04 (2014) 169, Phys.Lett. B718 (2013) 841-859) and became the reference
        person for statistical interpretations in ATLAS SUSY EWK searches. In
        one these searches I also measured the most important background, WZ.
  \item I combined the three lepton electroweak SUSY search with a search in a
        final state with two leptons (JHEP 05 (2014) 071).
  \item During the Long Shutdown 1, I supervised a student and we released a
        public note (ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-005) assessing the discovery potential of
        gluinos as a function of their mass and the integrated luminosity in the
        final state with one lepton.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{12pt}
\section{Analysis activities in CMS (since 2015)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I thoroughly studied and compared the software packages that ATLAS and
        CMS use to carry out their statistical interpretations of analyses to
        understand the differences in features and scope.
  \item I carried out a phenomenological study to understand what parts of the
        SUSY phase space can explain the relic abundance of dark matter, but
        is not currently covered by SUSY searches.
  \item I led the search for strongly produced SUSY particles in final states
        with a single lepton to a publication (10.1016/j.physletb.2018.03.028).
        I was responsible for organizing and coordinating the analysis,
        optimizing the analysis strategy and presenting the analysis to the
        collaboration for approval. The optimization of the search strategy led
        to an improvement in the exclusion limit for the gluino mass of 100~GeV
        in the limit of low LSP masses. In addition I was responsible for the
        measurement of the multijet background.
  \item I am one of the main analyzers in the soft multilepton group that is
        targeting light natural higgsinos. I carried out phenomenological studies and
        added an interpretation, that could solve the hierarchy problem and provide an
        excellent candidate for dark matter. This analysis is expected to be one of
        the first SUSY searches to use the combined dataset of 2016 and 2017. I am the
        contact person for the publication that is submitted to PLB (arXiv:1801.01846
        [hep-ex]).
  \item I assessed the sensitivity of a SUSY search in a final state of two low
        momentum leptons for the HL-LHC with an integrated luminosity of 3000
        fb$^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass energy of 14~TeV and 200 additional pileup
        events. To develop the analysis itself, I contributed significantly to
        the validation of Delphes (JHEP 02 (2014) 057) for HL-LHC searches. This
        in turn enabled the development of searches for SUSY in the final states
        with two same-charge leptons and taus. These analyses will be included
        in the upcoming Yellow Report for the European Strategy for Particle
        Physics and documented in a PAS that is in preparation.
  \item I am the SUSY Leptonic co-convener, organizing biweekly meetings,
        coordinating and reviewing the effort of several analyses that either
        search for electroweakly produced SUSY or use at least two leptons in
        their final state.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{12pt}
\section{Detector R\&D for the Phase-1 upgrade and MC simulations for HL-LHC on
ATLAS (up to 2015)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I set up the laboratory at the University of Bern that was used for the
        test of the optical receivers for the read out of the insertable b-layer
        (IBL), which is the additional pixel detector layer, closest to the
        interaction point, that was added in the ATLAS experiment during the
        Long Shutdown 1. I defined the acceptance criteria for the optical
        receivers, based on the reliability, sensitivity to the input light
        intensity and frequency range, and then used them to qualify the
        receivers finally installed in the cavern. I presented the results on
        this qualification in the ATLAS IBL general meetings. My work has helped
        establishing the group of the University of Bern as a leader for this
        kind of measurements in ATLAS.
  \item While at TRIUMF, I have contributed to the design of the Phase-2 tracker
        upgrade of the ATLAS detector with Monte Carlo studies of different
        geometries of the silicon inner detector (ITk), focusing in particular on
        the benefits, from the point of view of physics analyses, of a possible
        extension of the rapidity coverage of the tracker. I also studied the
        impact of using a new tracking algorithm originally developed for Run-2
        of ATLAS, called TIDE (Tracking in dense environments) on the proposed
        ITk layouts. Finally, I supervised a Ph.D. student who was studying the
        tracking efficiency as a function of the total number of pixel and strip
        layers in the ATLAS tracker. All these studies have been an important
        input to the ITk community in defining the best layout of the inner
        tracker.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{12pt}
\section{Detector R\&D for HL-LHC on CMS (since 2015)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I have worked in two areas related to the R\&D program for the CMS
        Phase-2 Outer Tracker: the development of a data acquisition tool
        (\textit{otsdaq}) that could be used in all phases of the detector
        development and construction (from bench tests of individual components
        to data taking in a beam with multiple detectors), and hardware tests of
        prototypes of modules and of parts of modules.
  \item I measured the properties of the first macro-pixel prototype, the
        MaPSA-Light, that combined a silicon sensor with a dedicated readout
        chip. In CMS, these macro-pixel detectors will be attached to a strip
        detector to form the PS modules. Using a laser system to generate
        charges in the silicon sensor I performed efficiency and time-walk
        measurements for the first time in a MaPSA-Light prototype.
  \item Later I measured the properties of all the available (three) Phase-2 2S
        modules (these are modules with two silicon strip sensors and
        electronics that form spatial coincidences between hits in the two
        layers). The characterization studies of these modules led to the
        discovery of several flaws in the firmware, software and module design,
        all of which have been later fixed. The results from these tests have
        been included in the CMS Technical Design Report for the Phase-2
        tracking system.
  \item I have qualified all full-sized hybrids for the 2S modules (these are
        flexible circuits that are used to connect the two silicon strip layers
        in a 2S module) that have been commercially manufactured, prior to their
        use for the construction of prototype modules in different CMS member
        institutions.
  \item I have set up several read out systems at CERN and at Fermilab, both to
        read out Outer Tracker modules and hybrids. The read out system set up
        at Fermilab has later been used in the test beam, where we measured for
        the first time the response of version 3 of the CBC ASIC to a particle
        beam.
  \item I developed the Outer Tracker part of \textit{otsdaq} (off-the-shelf
        DAQ), a generic data acquisition tool for particle physics experiments.
        \textit{otsdaq} has been used in several test beams, both at CERN and at
        Fermilab. It provides a graphical user interface for simple and
        efficient data taking, live data quality monitoring and a graphical user
        interface to configure the detector.
  \item I participated in several test beams, by setting up the system and allow
        for efficient data taking. The data from these test beams will be used
        for a publication that is in preparation.
\end{itemize}

\section{research experience}

I have been a member of the ATLAS Collaboration and currently am a member of the
CMS Collaboration. My research program in both collaborations has been driven by
the search for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles. I focus on natural SUSY searches
that could solve the hierarchy problem, as well as providing a dark matter
candidate that could explain the relic abundance of dark matter particles that
we see in the Universe. I either searched for light gluinos or light
electroweakinos.

The success of my research program at the HL-LHC will depend upon the
performance of the upgraded detector. Both the IBL upgrade at ATLAS and
the Outer Tracker upgrade at CMS that I worked on, improved or will improve the
tracking performance of the detector.

\textit{SUSY Search in two soft oppositely charged lepton final states in CMS}
\normalsize{}

A corner stone of my research program is the hunt for higgsino-like least
supersymmetric particles (LSP). Higgsino particles are elusive in nature.  As
the only mass term that enters the Higgs boson's radiative corrections at the
tree level, it is the most important ingredient to control the mass of the Higgs
boson and therefore the most important parameter to avoid fine tuning.

In the search for two soft opposite lepton final states, I first established a
phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM), to complement
the Simplified Models we are using and to understand if by using the simplified
versions of the SUSY models, we indeed cover all the phase space and are not
missing some corners. The model has also been used by a soft single lepton stop
search, to assess if they are sensitive to higgsinos.

The results of this search have been published in a paper
(\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01846}{arXiv:1801.01846 [hep-ex]}) that has
been submitted to PLB.

\textit{Upgrade study to assess the sensitivity in SUSY models at the HL-LHC} \\
\normalsize{}

The HL-LHC upgrade implies extreme challenges for the design of the detector,
but also for the reconstruction and identification of particles. By increasing
the instantaneous luminosity, additional soft proton-proton collisions (pileup)
are contaminating the hard process we are interested in. This poses a problem
especially for soft objects, as for example in the search for SUSY in two soft
oppositely charged lepton final states. It therefore needs to be carefully
studied, how much the improved detector and the large dataset benefits the
search and how much the additional pileup events hurt the sensitivity.

I carried out a study to assess the sensitivity with the Phase-2 detector in an
environment with up to 200 pileup events, and will continue to do so for the
Yellow Report. In my study I compared the performance of FullSim detector
simulation with the ones from Delphes, measured reconstruction and
identification efficiencies in FullSim samples and improved the Delphes detector
simulation to match the one obtained by FullSim. I assessed the performance of
the missing transverse momentum in both detector simulation and compared how
much they degrade compared to Run-2, due to additional pileup events.

\textit{SUSY Search exploiting the $\Delta \phi$ variable in single lepton final states in CMS} \\
\normalsize{}

With a small dataset of 13 TeV at hand, the discovery potential for strongly
produced SUSY was much larger than for electroweakinos. Therefore I focused at
the beginning of Run-2, on light gluinos, consider both decays mediated by light
stops or light squarks.

In this search in a final state with exactly one lepton, I exploited the angle
between the reconstructed $W$ and the lepton to search for SUSY events. I
organized the group meetings and lead the group to a publication in PLB
(\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2018.03.028}{10.1016/j.physletb.2018.03.028})
I streamlined and optimized the binning of this search, to maximize the
sensitivity for a given signal and also represented the analysis group in the
approval talk.

\vspace{15pt}
\Large{}
\textit{SUSY Search in single lepton final states in ATLAS} \\
\normalsize{}

Shortly before the start of Run-2, we assessed the sensitivity we could expect
for a search for light gluinos with a dataset of ? fb$^{-1}$. Skip this since
it's only a CONF-NOTE?

\vspace{15pt}
\Large{}
\textit{SUSY Search in multi lepton final states in ATLAS} \\
\normalsize{}

During my PhD I searched for electroweakly produced SUSY in final states with
three leptons and R-parity violating signal in final states with four leptons.
As one of the first SUSY searches in ATLAS, I introduced a binning covering a
large parameter space and being sensitive to many different SUSY signals. I also
optimized the signal regions in final states of three leptons including one tau. 

I was also responsible for the statistical interpretations of results by
calculating discovery p-values, exclusion contours and upper limits on model
cross-sections. I helped implementing a data driven estimate of the most
important background, $WZ$, in the three lepton final state. The tools
developed during this process have also been used by other analyses. This effort
has led to a total of 4 papers
(\href{https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.052002}
{Phys.  Rev. D 93, 052002 (2016)},
\href{https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.052001}

{Phys.Lett. B718 (2013) 841-859})
, on which I have been a driving analyst.

\vspace{15pt}
\Large{}
\textit{Test several electrical prototypes of the Outer Tracker upgrade} \\
\normalsize{}

I tested several electrical prototypes of the Outer Tracker upgrade. I
characterized all available full-sized module assemblies with version 2 of the
prototype ASIC called CBC. The results went into the TDR (link?). I also tested
the hybrids that we received from the manufacturer before they have been
distributed to the different institutes. In several testbeams I helped setting
up the device in the testbeam area and was responsible for efficient data
taking.

I also contributed to the development of \textit{otsdaq}, which is an
off-the-shell DAQ solution for high energy physics experiments. I adopted the
software to be used for the Phase-2 Outer Tracker modules and implementing the
existing Phase-2 Outer Tracker software framework into \textit{otsdaq}. I have
introduced the tool to the Phase-2 Outer Tracker community by giving
presentations and a hands-on session at the Phase-2 Outer Tracker Workshop.

\vspace{15pt}
\Large{}
\textit{Test optical receivers for suitability with IBL detector} \\
\normalsize{}

For the IBL upgrade during Long-Shutdown-1 I have tested the optical readout
components to be used off-detector. During these tests, I helped building up the
IBL activities at the University of Bern. I have tested the feasibility of the
usage for commerical products and selected the best suited candidate based on
the experimental test data that I took. I also replaced optical transmitters
that ceased to function during operation in Run-1.
